What does it mean to be object-oriented?

Goal: think in objects. Spend time noticing the little stories in the interactions that our code implements. The stories of the workflows that our users go through. When we see a story, no matter how small it is, we can give it a name. And that name can become an object.

Principles:

- encapsulation
- message-sending
- late binding

History

- Object orientation is a way of looking at problems.
- It is the brainchild of Alan Kay (1960s), smalltalk. Note: Ruby and it's influence Smalltalk allows for open classes and rewriting code, which is a mindshift change if you're coming from a compiled language (e.g. Java).
- It is an architectural style.
- "local retention and protection of hiding state-process". How does this relate to functions with no side effects?
- Polymorphism is a subset of "late binding". Our example uses symbolic names instead of object references.
